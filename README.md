# Course Registration

This project is a course registration form developed as part of a Spring Boot project. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users (admin, faculty, or students) to log in and register for courses. Each user type is redirected to a customized dashboard after login, with additional OTP-based login for faculty and students.

- **User Role Redirection**: Admins are redirected to the admin dashboard, faculty to the faculty page, and students to the student page.
- **OTP Login**: Faculty and students can log in with OTP-based verification.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Navigation**: Includes a navigation bar with dropdown options.
